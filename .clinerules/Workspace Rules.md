# Good coding practice
- Don't apply changes that are not required - keep changes minimal,
- Whenever possible, use .ui xml files instead of programatically creating UI objects, 
- Activate venv 'env',
- Write test for new code, if applicable,
- Comment generously.
- if possible, when trying to identify a bug, first write a test that fails on the bug, then fix the problem, and test again to sure the bug is fixed.
